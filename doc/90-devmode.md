## Power of the documentation

- Use it for release notes
- Generate a manual
- Have something to read in GitHub
- Use it as presentation in no time


### Tools

Within the doc folder you find some helpful scripts:

- makeManual.sh - will generate a Manual.pdf
- makePresentation.php - will create a reveal.js presentation

Note: This is all generated by using the MD


### Structure

To make this possible the MD must have this:

- Double-New-Line to let it be a new slide (e.g. above headings)
- "Note: " as prefix for paragraphs that shall be a note in presentation.
- A limit of 5 bullets or one image per slide.
- Clean structure and short sentences.
